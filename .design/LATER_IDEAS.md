# Altera Labs - "Save For Later" Ideas

This document is a parking lot for features and ideas that are important but not part of the immediate development cycle. This helps us stay focused without losing valuable insights.

## Feature Ideas

- **Universal Knowledge Graph:** A macro-level graph that connects concepts across all of a student's classes (e.g., linking Linear Algebra concepts to their applications in Physics).
- **Handwriting Recognition:** OCR technology to convert handwritten notes or homework problems from images into a digital, analyzable format.
- **Gamification - The Learning Garden:** A visual metaphor (like the Forest app) where consistent, healthy learning habits (using Study Mode, high performance in exams) make a digital garden flourish. Using "panic mode" or cognitive offloading behaviors might cause plants to wilt, providing a gentle, visual feedback loop on learning quality.
- **Calendar Integration (Canvas/gCal):** Proactively remind students about upcoming deadlines and suggest study sessions.
- **Knowledge Decay Function:** Implement a forgetting curve model to prompt students to review concepts they haven't engaged with recently, strengthening long-term retention.
- **HumorHealer-esque Feature:** Integrate a chatbot focused on emotional intelligence and managing academic stress, providing support beyond the purely academic.

## Architecture & Data Ideas

- **Advanced BKT Models:** Continuously research and integrate improvements to the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model to better handle partial knowledge, skill dependencies, and forgetting curves.
- **Reading Comprehension Training:** A feature to fine-tune a model's reading comprehension by training it on specific reading-comprehension assessment datasets before it ingests a syllabus or textbook.

## New Design Ideas (Added from Navigation Discussion)

### **Visual Feedback & Gamification**
- **Proof Progress Flowers:** Animated flowers that bloom around proofs as students make progress, with different themes available
- **Lightbulb Animations:** Satisfying animations when new skills are unlocked, with points system
- **Leaderboard/Progress Tracker:** Integration of points earned through skill mastery into competitive/progress tracking features
- **Subtle Mood Indicators:** Real-time affective state detection with gentle visual cues (not overwhelming)

### **Dashboard & Analytics**
- **Class Health Dashboard:** Overview showing "health" and progress across different classes with quick stats
- **Metrics Panels:** Clean, non-distracting displays of "Hypothesis Testing: 78% success rate", "Concept Retention: 92%", "Cognitive Load: Optimal"
- **Separate Analytics Page:** Detailed analytics (BKT probabilities, affective states, learning patterns) on dedicated page to avoid distraction
- **Progress Tracking:** "Time in Flow State: 23 minutes", "Concepts Reinforced: 5" with detailed analytics

### **Personalization & Memory**
- **Long-term Emotional Tracking:** Learning what's most effective for each user's learning style
- **Partnership Insights:** "Your AI partner has learned your thinking style", "You're most effective in morning sessions"
- **Personalized Greetings:** "Good morning Maya! I noticed you were working on subgroup proofs yesterday. Shall we continue?"
- **Memory Integration:** Store insights and connect with Bayesian knowledge graph model of user understanding

### **Core Value Propositions**
- **Practice Problem Creation:** Ability for users to create practice problems (with verified solutions) on topics they're struggling with
- **Metacognitive Prompts:** "Research Questions" like "Why did you choose this approach?", "What assumptions are you making?"
- **Real-time BKT Updates:** Smooth animations for mastery updates as learning happens
