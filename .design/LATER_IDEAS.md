# Altera Labs - "Save For Later" Ideas

This document is a parking lot for features and ideas that are important but not part of the immediate development cycle. This helps us stay focused without losing valuable insights.

## Feature Ideas

- **Universal Knowledge Graph:** A macro-level graph that connects concepts across all of a student's classes (e.g., linking Linear Algebra concepts to their applications in Physics).
- **Handwriting Recognition:** OCR technology to convert handwritten notes or homework problems from images into a digital, analyzable format.
- **Gamification - The Learning Garden:** A visual metaphor (like the Forest app) where consistent, healthy learning habits (using Study Mode, high performance in exams) make a digital garden flourish. Using "panic mode" or cognitive offloading behaviors might cause plants to wilt, providing a gentle, visual feedback loop on learning quality.
- **Calendar Integration (Canvas/gCal):** Proactively remind students about upcoming deadlines and suggest study sessions.
- **Knowledge Decay Function:** Implement a forgetting curve model to prompt students to review concepts they haven't engaged with recently, strengthening long-term retention.
- **HumorHealer-esque Feature:** Integrate a chatbot focused on emotional intelligence and managing academic stress, providing support beyond the purely academic.

## Architecture & Data Ideas

- **Advanced BKT Models:** Continuously research and integrate improvements to the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model to better handle partial knowledge, skill dependencies, and forgetting curves.
- **Reading Comprehension Training:** A feature to fine-tune a model's reading comprehension by training it on specific reading-comprehension assessment datasets before it ingests a syllabus or textbook.
