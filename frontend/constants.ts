**Course: Calculus I**

**Course Outline and Learning Objectives**

**Week 1-2: Limits and Continuity.** 
We will cover the intuitive definition of a limit, calculating limits using algebraic techniques, and the formal epsilon-delta definition. This foundation leads directly into the concept of continuity and its importance for function behavior.

**Week 3-5: Differentiation.** 
This section is the core of differential calculus. We will introduce the definition of the derivative, which is formally defined as the limit of a difference quotient. We will then learn essential differentiation rules to avoid using the limit definition every time: the Power Rule, the Product Rule, and the crucial Chain Rule for composite functions.

**Week 6-7: Applications of the Derivative.**
We will use derivatives to solve real-world and theoretical problems. This includes finding local maxima and minima of functions to solve optimization problems. We will also tackle related rates problems, which requires a firm grasp of the Chain Rule to succeed.
