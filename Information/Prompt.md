### **Prompt: Synthesize a Strategic Options Dossier for Co-founder Deliberation**

**Objective:**
Your task is to act as a neutral, objective synthesizer of information. You will create a single, comprehensive document titled **"Altera Labs - Strategic Options Dossier"**. The purpose of this dossier is to provide my co-founders with a complete and unbiased evidence base to facilitate a collective, well-informed deliberation on the future strategic direction of our venture.

**Core Principle of Objectivity:**
This is the most critical instruction. **Your output must be strictly analytical and objective.** Do not adopt a persuasive tone or a narrative structure that leads to an "inevitable conclusion." Your function is to illuminate the available data, not to argue a case. Present evidence for and against each strategic path with equal rigor. Use neutral, descriptive language and, where appropriate, attribute information to its source document (e.g., "The *Strategic Venture Analysis* document identifies this as a high-risk area," or "Feedback from *I-Corps* indicated a user need for...").

**Source Documents:**
You will be provided with the following seven documents. You are to use these, and only these, as the source of truth for your synthesis.

1.  `StrategicOptionsDossierStructure.md`: **(Primary Blueprint)** This document contains the required structure and section headings for your final output. You must follow this structure precisely.
2.  `HumorHealer Status.md`: **(Source for Path A)** This document provides the baseline information, current status, and progress made on the "Wellness Companion" concept.
3.  `I-Corps additional feedback.md`: **(Source for Path A)** This contains customer discovery feedback relevant to the "Wellness Companion" concept. Use this to source the "Evidence For" section of the Path A analysis.
4.  `Copy of Startup Strategy_ AI Venture Analysis.txt`: **(Primary Analytical Source)** This is the core document for comparing the three strategic paths (Wellness, AI Tutor, B2B). It contains the decision matrix, risk profiles, and feasibility assessments. It is a primary source for **all sections** of the dossier.
5.  `AI Math Tutor Differentiation.md`: **(Primary Source for Path B)** This document provides the deep dive into the AI Tutor market, the competitive landscape, and the detailed breakdown of the four "Blue Ocean" differentiation vectors (Metacognitive, Affective, etc.). Use this to build out the "Concept Overview" and "Evidence For" sections of the Path B analysis.
6.  `Copy of Research Plan_ Lean 4 MVP.txt`: **(Technical Source for Path B)** This document provides the technical justification and feasibility analysis for the "Socratic Verifier" and the verifier-in-the-loop architecture. Use this to support the "Technical Moat Potential" section of the Path B analysis.
7.  `Conversation Synthesis: The Evolution of the Altera Labs Strategy.md`: **(Process & Context)** This document provides a chronological record of the analytical journey. Use it to inform the tone and to ensure the final dossier accurately reflects the sequence of analysis, but do not directly quote from it in a way that creates a persuasive narrative. Its primary value is for context.

**Instructions for Synthesis:**

1.  **Adhere to the Structure:** Your final output must strictly follow the section-by-section structure defined in `StrategicOptionsDossierStructure.md`. Use the specified headings and subheadings.
2.  **Populate from Sources:** Go through the provided structure and populate each section using information drawn exclusively from the seven source documents. Map the content correctly as outlined above.
3.  **Maintain Neutrality:** For each strategic path, present both the "Evidence For" (pros, opportunities, positive feedback) and "Evidence Against" (cons, risks, negative feedback) with equal analytical depth.
4.  **Conclude with the Discussion Framework:** The final section of the dossier must be the "Discussion Framework & Key Questions for Deliberation" as specified in the blueprint. Do not provide a final recommendation or a concluding summary. Your output should end with the list of questions, empowering the human team to begin their deliberation.
5.  **Synthesize, Do Not Simply Copy:** Do not copy-paste large blocks of text. Synthesize the key findings, data points, and arguments from the source documents into a coherent, readable, and well-organized final dossier.

Execute this task now. The final output should be the complete text of the "Altera Labs - Strategic Options Dossier".
