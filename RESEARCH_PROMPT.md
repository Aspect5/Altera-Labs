# Research Prompt for Google Deep Research: Advanced Lean 4 Theorem Proving System Optimization

## Executive Summary

We are developing an AI-powered math education platform called **Altera Labs** that combines Lean 4 theorem proving with large language models to provide personalized mathematical tutoring. Our system has achieved moderate performance improvements (41% time reduction) but falls short of our 70% target and has significant proof-solving capability issues. We need comprehensive research into state-of-the-art theorem proving approaches, performance optimization techniques, and potential integration of specialized proof models.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **Lean 4 Theorem Prover**: Uses Mathlib for formal mathematics verification
2. **Python Flask Backend**: RESTful API serving proof verification and generation
3. **React TypeScript Frontend**: Interactive mathematical tutoring interface
4. **Google Vertex AI Integration**: LLM-powered tactic generation and natural language processing
5. **Performance Optimization Layer**: Caching, parallel processing, and environment optimization

### Current Performance Optimizations Implemented

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Proof-Solving Capability Problems
- **LLM Tactic Generation Issues**: Generated tactics often fail with syntax errors
- **Goal/Tactic Mismatch**: LLM generates tactics for wrong goals (e.g., commutativity tactics for simple arithmetic)
- **Tactic Parsing Errors**: Frequent "introN failed, insufficient number of binders" errors
- **Complex Proof Failures**: Associativity and commutativity proofs consistently fail

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Only 21.2% vs 80% target
- **LLM Response Time**: 15-34s average response time (too slow)
- **Lean Verification Time**: 10-15s per verification attempt
- **Environment Warm-up**: Inconsistent success (0-7/11 proofs successful)

### 3. Architecture Limitations
- **Generic LLM Approach**: Using general-purpose LLM for specialized theorem proving
- **Limited Tactic Library**: Basic tactic generation without advanced proof strategies
- **No Proof Planning**: No hierarchical proof decomposition
- **Inefficient Error Recovery**: No learning from failed attempts

## Research Objectives
