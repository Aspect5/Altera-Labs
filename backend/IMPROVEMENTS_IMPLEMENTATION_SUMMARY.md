# AI Prover Improvements Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements implemented to address the issues identified in the AI_PROVER_CAPABILITIES_ANALYSIS.md test results, which showed a 0% success rate.

## Key Issues Identified from Test Results

### 1. Syntax Errors in Generated Lean Code
- **Problem**: LLM was generating tactics with incorrect syntax, markdown formatting, and import statements
- **Impact**: All generated tactics failed Lean verification due to syntax errors

### 2. Missing Proper Lean File Structure
- **Problem**: Generated code didn't follow proper Lean syntax and structure
- **Impact**: Lean compiler couldn't parse the generated code

### 3. Incorrect Tactic Usage
- **Problem**: LLM was not properly structuring Lean proofs
- **Impact**: Tactics were malformed and couldn't be applied

### 4. Poor Error Handling
- **Problem**: System wasn't learning effectively from failures
- **Impact**: No improvement across multiple attempts

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering (`enhanced_prompts.py`)

#### Added Comprehensive Lean Syntax Guide
```python
CRITICAL LEAN SYNTAX RULES:
1. NEVER include import statements in your tactic - imports are handled separately
2. NEVER include 'open' statements in your tactic
3. NEVER include theorem declarations in your tactic
4. Use `intro` to introduce variables: `intro n`
5. Use `exact` with theorem names: `exact Nat.add_zero`
6. Use `simp` with lemma lists: `simp [Nat.add_zero, Nat.mul_add]`
7. Use `rw` for rewriting: `rw [Nat.add_zero]`
8. Use `rfl` for reflexivity: `rfl`
9. Use `constructor` for bidirectional proofs: `constructor`
10. Use `cases` for case analysis: `cases Classical.em P with`
11. NEVER include markdown formatting in Lean code
12. NEVER include explanatory text within Lean code blocks
13. ALWAYS use proper Lean syntax without extra characters
14. ONLY generate the tactic itself, not the surrounding code structure
```

#### Enhanced Error Pattern Recognition
- Added specific patterns for syntax errors, unknown constants, type mismatches
- Improved error classification with specific suggestions
- Better error learning capabilities

#### Improved Context-Aware Prompts
- Better integration with knowledge base
- More specific instructions for different difficulty levels
- Enhanced error history integration

### 2. Improved Error Handling (`lean_verifier.py`)

#### Enhanced Error Parsing
```python
def parse_lean_error_output(self, error_output: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Parse syntax errors
    syntax_patterns = [
        r"unexpected token '([^']+)'",
        r"syntax error",
        r"invalid '([^']+)' command",
        r"unexpected token 'by'; expected '{' or tactic",
        r"unsolved goals"
    ]
    
    # Parse unknown identifier errors
    unknown_pattern = r"unknown (?:constant|identifier) '([^']+)'"
    
    # Parse type mismatch errors
    type_patterns = [
        r"Application type mismatch",
        r"type mismatch",
        r"unsolved goals"
    ]
```

#### Better Syntax Validation
```python
def _validate_proof_syntax(self, proof_code: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Check for markdown formatting
    if '```' in proof_code or '`' in proof_code:
        issues.append("Contains markdown formatting")
    
    # Check for import statements in tactics
    if 'import ' in proof_code:
        issues.append("Contains import statement in tactic")
    
    # Check for proper tactic structure
    valid_tactics = ['intro', 'exact', 'simp', 'rw', 'rfl', 'constructor', 'cases', 'induction', 'ring', 'norm_num']
```

#### Improved Tactic Extraction
```python
def _extract_lean_tactic(self, response: str) -> str:
    # Remove markdown code blocks
    response = re.sub(r'```lean\s*', '', response)
    response = re.sub(r'```\s*', '', response)
    
    # Skip import statements, open statements, theorem declarations
    if line.startswith('import ') or line.startswith('open ') or line.startswith('theorem '):
        continue
```

### 3. Knowledge Base Improvements (`lean_knowledge_base.py`)

#### Enhanced Theorem Suggestions
```python
def suggest_theorem(self, goal: str) -> Optional[str]:
    # Pattern matching for common goals
    patterns = {
        r"∀\s*n\s*,\s*n\s*\+\s*0\s*=\s*n": "Nat.add_zero",
        r"∀\s*a\s*b\s*,\s*a\s*\+\s*b\s*=\s*b\s*\+\s*a": "Nat.add_comm",
        r"∀\s*a\s*b\s*c\s*,\s*a\s*\*\s*\(b\s*\+\s*c\)\s*=\s*a\s*\*\s*b\s*\+\s*a\s*\*\s*c": "Nat.mul_add",
        # ... more patterns
    }
```

#### Better Tactic Generation
```python
def get_tactics_for_goal(self, goal: str, difficulty: str = "medium") -> List[str]:
    suggested_theorem = self.suggest_theorem(goal)
    tactics = []
    
    if suggested_theorem:
        # Add direct theorem application
        if suggested_theorem == "Nat.add_zero":
            tactics.append("intro n; exact Nat.add_zero n")
        elif suggested_theorem == "Nat.add_comm":
            tactics.append("intro a b; exact Nat.add_comm a b")
        # ... more specific tactics
```

### 4. Enhanced Auto-Solve System

#### Improved Strategy Selection
- Better goal classification (addition_identity, commutativity, distributivity, etc.)
- Difficulty-based strategy selection
- Enhanced error learning across attempts

#### Better Attempt Management
```python
def auto_solve_proof(self, initial_proof_state: str, max_attempts: int = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Generate tactic based on attempt number and error history
    if attempt_num == 1:
        # First attempt: use context-aware prompt
        prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_context_aware_prompt(...)
    elif attempt_num <= 3:
        # Early attempts: use error learning
        prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_error_learning_prompt(...)
    else:
        # Later attempts: use fallback strategy
        prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_fallback_prompt(...)
```
