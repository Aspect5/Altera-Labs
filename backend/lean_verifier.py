class LeanVerifier:
    """
    A service class to interact with the Lean 4 proof assistant.

    This class is responsible for taking a student's natural language proof step,
    translating it into a formal Lean tactic, and verifying it against the current
    proof state.

    For Phase 3 development, this will be expanded to:
    1.  Use an LLM to translate natural language to a Lean tactic.
    2.  Invoke the Lean process with the current proof file and the new tactic.
    3.  Parse the output from Lean to determine if the proof step was successful,
        resulted in an error, or completed the proof.
    4.  Return the new proof state and any pedagogical feedback.
