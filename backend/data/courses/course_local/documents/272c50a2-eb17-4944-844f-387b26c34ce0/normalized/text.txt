Honors Analysis I
Homework 1
Due by September 10th at 11:59pm EST on Gradescope
To submit this assignment, you will need a scanned copy of your homework saved as a PDF via
Gradescope. If you write out your assignment on paper, you can create a PDF file by using a scanning
app (e.g. the Gradescope app) on your phone or tablet, or using a scanner in the library. Once you
have your PDF copy of your homework, head to the course Canvas page and select Gradescope from
the left hand menu. Once in Gradescope select the correct assignment to turn in (e.g. “Homework
1”) and follow the prompts to upload your PDF. It will ask you to tag the problems on each page
of your submission so the grader can find your work (don’t skip this step!). After you have tagged
the PDF you are ready to submit.
There are 4 questions to answer for a total of 30 points:
1. [3 points] Suppose x and y are real, and x ≤y + ϵ for every ϵ > 0. Show that x ≤y.
2. [4 points] (Rudin, Chapter 1, #5): Let A be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded
below. Let −A be the set of all numbers −x, where x ∈A. Prove that
inf A = −sup(−A).
3. [8 points] Show that:
(a) k ≤2k for every natural number k ∈N by induction.
(b) The dyadic rationals are the rationals of the form
 j
2k : j ∈Z, k ∈N

.
Prove that for any two real numbers x < y, there exists a dyadic rational p such that
x < p < y.
4. [15 points] (Rudin, Chapter 1, #6): Fix b > 1.
(a) If m, n, p, q are integers, n > 0, q > 0, and r = m/n = p/q, prove that
(bm)1/n = (bp)1/q.
Hence it makes sense to define br = (bm)1/n.
(b) Prove that br+s = brbs if r and s are rational.
(c) If x is real, define B(x) to be the set of all numbers bt, where t is rational and t ≤x. Prove
that
br = sup B(r)
when r is rational. Hence it makes sense to define
bx = sup B(x)
for every real x

(d) Prove that bx+y = bxby for all real x and y following the steps outlined below:
i. First prove that bxby ≤bx+y directly.
ii. Show that if b > 1 and n ∈N, then b
1
n > 1.
iii. Show that if x > 0 and x ∈R, then (1 + x)n ≥1 + nx for every n ∈N.
iv. Show that if b > 1 and n ∈N, then 1 < b
1
n < 1 + b−1
n .
v. Show that if u, v ∈Q, u > v, and b > 1, then bu > bv.
vi. Note that, by the law of exponential for integers and #4(b), we have
1 = b0 = b
1
n+(−1
n) = b
1
nb−1
n.
vii. Let ϵ > 0 be arbitrary, and let n ∈N be small enough (you need to specify this n).
viii. By the density of rationals, we can choose r, s ∈Q such that
x −1
2n < r < x,
y −1
2n < s < y,
and thus
x + y −1
n < r + s < x + y.
ix. Now let t ∈Q be such that t ≤x + y. By trichotomy, we have three different cases:
t < r + s,
t = r + s,
t > r + s.
x. If t ≤r + s, show that bt ≤bx+y.
xi. If r + s < t, then show that
t −1
n < r + s < t ≤x + y,
and using this and the above lemmas, show that
bt < bxby + ϵ.
xii. Thus, in any case, we have
bt < bxby + ϵ.
xiii. Show that if bx+y > bxby, then we get a contradition, and thus, bx+y ≤bxby.
Additional problems (for your own practice)
Do not turn in these, but I am happy to discuss:
