## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Compositional Reasoning (Ineq-Comp Inspired)

#### A. Compositional Reasoning Patterns
```python
# Enhanced pattern recognition for complex mathematical structures
compositional_patterns = {
    # Variable duplication patterns
    r".*\(.*\+.*\)\^2.*": "binomial_expansion",
    r".*\(.*\-.*\)\^2.*": "binomial_expansion",
    
    # Algebraic rewriting patterns
    r".*\*\s*\(.*\+.*\).*": "Nat.mul_add",
    r".*\*\s*\(.*\-.*\).*": "Nat.mul_sub",
    
    # Multi-step composition patterns
    r".*≤.*≤.*": "transitivity_inequality",
    r".*<.*<.*": "transitivity_strict_inequality",
    r".*=\s*.*=\s*.*": "transitivity_equality"
}
```

#### B. Human-Intuitive Strategy Generation
```python
def get_compositional_strategies(self, goal: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Get compositional reasoning strategies for complex goals.
    Based on Ineq-Comp research on human-intuitive compositional reasoning.
    """
    strategies = []
    
    # Decomposition strategies
    if "↔" in goal or "iff" in goal.lower():
        strategies.append("DECOMPOSE_BIDIRECTIONAL: Break into two separate implications")
    
    # Variable duplication strategies
    if "(" in goal and ")" in goal and ("+" in goal or "-" in goal):
        strategies.append("VARIABLE_DUPLICATION: Use substitution to handle repeated patterns")
    
    # Algebraic rewriting strategies
    if "=" in goal and ("+" in goal or "*" in goal):
        strategies.append("ALGEBRAIC_REWRITING: Use systematic transformations to simplify")
    
    # Multi-step composition strategies
    if "≤" in goal or "<" in goal:
        strategies.append("TRANSITIVITY_CHAIN: Use transitivity properties to chain inequalities")
    
    return strategies
```

### 2. DREAM Approach Implementation

#### A. Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification
```python
def create_axiom_driven_prompt(self, goal: str, available_axioms: List[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Create prompts that encourage diverse proof strategies using available axioms.
    Based on the DREAM approach for axiom-driven strategy diversification.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    AXIOM-DRIVEN STRATEGY DIVERSIFICATION (Based on DREAM Research):
    1. DIRECT AXIOM APPLICATION: Try applying axioms directly to the goal
    2. CONTRAPOSITIVE APPROACH: Consider proving the contrapositive if direct proof fails
    3. PROOF BY CONTRADICTION: Assume the negation and derive a contradiction
    4. INDUCTION STRATEGY: Use mathematical induction if the goal involves natural numbers
    5. DECOMPOSITION: Break the goal into simpler sub-goals and solve each separately
    6. ALGEBRAIC MANIPULATION: Use systematic transformations to simplify expressions
    
    COMPOSITIONAL REASONING APPROACH:
    - Identify the core mathematical structure of the goal
    - Look for patterns that can be decomposed into simpler parts
    - Use human-intuitive reasoning rather than brute force
    - Consider multiple proof strategies before choosing the best one
    """
    return prompt
```

#### B. Sub-Proposition Error Feedback
```python
def create_sub_proposition_feedback_prompt(self, goal: str, failed_attempt: str, sub_goals: List[str] = None) -> str:
    """
    Create prompts that help LLMs reflect on and correct sub-proposition errors.
    Based on the DREAM approach for sub-proposition error feedback.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    SUB-PROPOSITION ERROR ANALYSIS (Based on DREAM Research):
    1. WHICH SUB-PROPOSITION FAILED? Identify the specific part that caused the failure
    2. WHAT WAS THE REASONING ERROR? Analyze the logical flaw in the approach
    3. HOW CAN THIS BE CORRECTED? Suggest specific fixes for the identified error
    4. WHAT ALTERNATIVE APPROACH SHOULD BE TRIED? Propose a different proof strategy
    
    ERROR CORRECTION STRATEGIES:
    - If a sub-goal is too complex, break it down further
    - If an axiom application failed, try a different axiom or approach
    - If the reasoning was circular, find a more direct path
    - If the proof was too long, look for shortcuts or simplifications
    """
    return prompt
```

### 3. Enhanced Auto-Solve with Research-Based Strategies

```python
def auto_solve_proof(self, initial_proof_state: str, max_attempts: int = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Auto-solve a proof with improved error learning and strategy selection.
    Enhanced with DREAM approach: Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification and Sub-Proposition Error Feedback.
    """
    for attempt_num in range(1, max_attempts + 1):
        if attempt_num == 1:
            # First attempt: use axiom-driven strategy diversification (DREAM approach)
            prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_axiom_driven_prompt(
                goal=initial_proof_state,
                available_axioms=lean_kb.get_available_theorems()
            )
        elif attempt_num == 2:
            # Second attempt: use context-aware prompt with error learning
            prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_context_aware_prompt(
                goal=initial_proof_state,
                error_history=error_history,
                difficulty=difficulty
            )
        elif attempt_num == 3:
            # Third attempt: use sub-proposition error feedback (DREAM approach)
            prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_sub_proposition_feedback_prompt(
                goal=initial_proof_state,
                failed_attempt=attempts[-1] if attempts else "",
                sub_goals=enhanced_prompts._extract_sub_goals(initial_proof_state)
            )
```

### 4. Sub-Goal Extraction and Analysis

```python
def _extract_sub_goals(self, goal: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Extract potential sub-goals from a complex goal.
    """
    sub_goals = []
    
    # For bidirectional proofs
    if "↔" in goal or "iff" in goal.lower():
        parts = goal.split("↔") if "↔" in goal else goal.split("iff")
        if len(parts) == 2:
            sub_goals.extend([f"Prove: {parts[0].strip()}", f"Prove: {parts[1].strip()}"])
    
    # For universal quantifiers with multiple variables
    if goal.count("∀") > 1:
        import re
        matches = re.findall(r'∀\s*([^,]+),\s*([^∀]+)', goal)
        for var, prop in matches:
            sub_goals.append(f"∀ {var}, {prop.strip()}")
    
    # For complex equalities, suggest breaking into parts
    if "=" in goal and ("+" in goal or "*" in goal):
        sub_goals.append("Simplify left side")
        sub_goals.append("Simplify right side")
        sub_goals.append("Show equality")
    
    return sub_goals
```
