# **Altera Labs \- The AI Cognitive Partner**

Altera Labs is a student-led venture from Johns Hopkins University dedicated to building a pedagogically superior AI tutor for STEM education. Our mission is to create an **AI Cognitive Partner** that enhances a student's critical thinking skills, rather than just providing answers.  
This project has evolved beyond its initial "Proof State Auditor" MVP into a more comprehensive learning platform. It now features a sophisticated, multi-modal architecture designed to support students through their entire learning lifecycle, from understanding concepts to completing assignments and preparing for exams.

## **‚ú® Core Features**

The application is designed around two primary workflows: a collaborative **Homework Mode** and a high-stakes **Exam Mode**.

* **Syllabus-Driven Knowledge Graph**: Users begin by uploading a class syllabus (.pdf, .txt). The AI analyzes it and generates a dynamic, interactive **Knowledge Graph** of the course's key concepts and their dependencies.  
* **Contextual Inquiry ("Highlight-to-Ask")**: While interacting with the AI, students can highlight any term or phrase to get a clear, university-level explanation tailored to the current context.  
* **The Socratic Verifier**: The cornerstone of the application, now enhanced with a more robust backend.  
  * **Metacognitive Scaffolding**: The AI guides students through a **Plan-Monitor-Reflect** cycle, prompting them to articulate their strategy and reflect on their learning.  
  * **Natural Language to Formal Verification**: Students propose proof steps in plain English or LaTeX. The system translates this into formal Lean 4 tactics and verifies them for logical correctness using a real Lean compiler.  
  * **Pedagogical Feedback**: If a step is incorrect, the AI uses the compiler's error to generate a targeted, Socratic hint, guiding the student without giving away the answer.  
* **Homework & Exam Modes**: The AI's entire pedagogical stance changes based on the user's selected mode. "Homework Mode" is collaborative and supportive, while "Exam Mode" is a sterile environment for true assessment.  
* **Advanced Student Modeling**: The system uses Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to build a persistent, personalized model of each student's mastery and uncertainty for every concept in the knowledge graph.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack**

| Component | Technologies |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Backend** | Python 3.11, Flask, **Google Cloud Vertex AI (Gemini Models)**, Lean 4 (via lake) |
| **Frontend** | React, Vite, **TypeScript**, Tailwind CSS, **D3.js** |
| **Development** | VS Code Dev Containers, Docker |

## **üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture**

The application uses a modular, pedagogically-driven client-server model.

1. **Web Layer (app.py)**: The Flask application serves as the main API gateway. It manages user sessions via secure cookies and orchestrates the backend modules based on the user's current mode (Homework/Exam).  
2. **Socratic Auditor Engine (socratic\_auditor.py)**: This is the core reasoning engine. It uses models hosted on **Vertex AI** to perform the initial translation of informal user input into Lean Syntax objects. It then uses the Lean 4 compiler's metaprogramming features to rigorously verify the logic and generate precise error messages.  
3. **Pedagogical Strategy Engine (metacognition.py)**: This module is the "brain" of the conversational flow. It manages the user's state within the **Plan-Monitor-Reflect** cycle and uses the student's dynamic knowledge model to tailor its feedback, hints, and overall strategy.  
4. **RAG Manager (rag\_manager.py)**: This module handles the persistence of user-uploaded documents, such as syllabi and homework assignments, forming the foundation of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

This project is configured to use VS Code Dev Containers, which is the **highly recommended** way to get started.

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Docker Desktop**: [Install from the official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).  
2. **Visual Studio Code**: [Install from the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
3. **VS Code Dev Containers extension**: [Install from the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).  
4. **Google Cloud SDK**: [Install and configure the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to handle Vertex AI authentication.

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository & Open in VS Code.**  
2. Authenticate with Google Cloud:  
   Before building the container, authenticate your local environment so the container can inherit the credentials.  
   gcloud auth application-default login

3. Create the Backend .env file:  
   Navigate to the backend directory and create a file named .env. Add the following content:  
   \# .env file for Altera Labs Backend  
   GOOGLE\_CLOUD\_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"  
   GOOGLE\_CLOUD\_LOCATION="your-gcp-region" \# e.g., us-central1  
   FLASK\_SECRET\_KEY="generate-a-long-random-string-for-production"

   *Note: The LAKE\_EXECUTABLE\_PATH is set automatically within the Dev Container.*  
4. Reopen in Container:  
   Open the project folder in VS Code. A pop-up will appear in the bottom-right corner. Click "Reopen in Container". This will build the Docker image and configure the environment, which may take several minutes on the first run.  
5. Run the Application:  
   Once the container is running, use two separate terminals inside VS Code (Terminal \> New Terminal).  
   * **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**  
     \# This command is run from the root of the workspace  
     python \-m backend.app

   * **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Server**  
     \# This command is also run from the root of the workspace  
     cd frontend  
     npm run dev

You can now open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
