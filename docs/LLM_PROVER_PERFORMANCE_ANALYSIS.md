# LLM Prover Performance Analysis & Optimization

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of recent logs (234 attempts), the LLM prover shows significant performance issues that need immediate attention:

- **Success Rate:** 0% in recent attempts
- **Average LLM Response Time:** 15.2 seconds (range: 1.7-30.5s)
- **Average Verification Time:** 16.8 seconds (range: 14.8-18.7s)
- **Total Time per Attempt:** 32-49 seconds

## Key Performance Issues

### 1. Excessive LLM Response Times
**Problem:** LLM responses take 1.7-30.5 seconds, with high variance
**Root Cause:** 
- Verbose explanations instead of concise tactics
- Complex reasoning chains instead of direct solutions
- No timeout enforcement

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added 10-second timeout warning
- Enhanced prompts to emphasize conciseness
- Added performance monitoring

### 2. High Verification Overhead
**Problem:** Lean verification consistently takes 15-19 seconds
**Root Cause:**
- Environment setup issues
- Inefficient verification process
- No caching of verification results

**Solutions Applied:**
- Added verification timing metrics
- Enhanced logging for performance analysis

### 3. Poor Error Learning
**Problem:** LLM doesn't learn effectively from failures
**Root Cause:**
- Complex error analysis instead of simple corrections
- No systematic learning from previous attempts

**Solutions Applied:**
- Enhanced error learning prompts
- Added performance-based strategy selection

### 4. Verbose Output Generation
**Problem:** LLM generates long explanations instead of focused tactics
**Root Cause:**
- Prompts encourage detailed reasoning
- No emphasis on conciseness

**Solutions Applied:**
- Updated prompts to emphasize concise responses
- Added rules against verbose explanations

## Performance Metrics Tracking

### New Metrics Added:
- `llm_time`: Time spent generating LLM response
- `verify_time`: Time spent verifying tactic
- `total_time`: Total time per attempt
- `strategy`: Strategy used for the attempt

### Performance Targets:
- **LLM Response Time:** < 5 seconds (target: 2-3 seconds)
- **Verification Time:** < 10 seconds (target: 5-7 seconds)
- **Total Time:** < 15 seconds per attempt
- **Success Rate:** > 50% within 3 attempts

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Prompt Engineering Improvements
- Emphasize conciseness over explanation
- Use simple tactics first approach
- Add timeout constraints to prompts

### 2. Verification Optimization
- Cache verification results
- Optimize Lean environment setup
- Use incremental verification

### 3. Error Learning Enhancement
- Implement systematic error pattern recognition
- Use simpler fallback strategies
- Add performance-based strategy selection

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automatic alerts for slow responses
- Performance trend analysis

## Implementation Status
