Additional Expert Insights from NSF I-Corps Business Idea Validation Program:

**Customer Discovery and Market Understanding:**

* **Interview Quantity for Insights:** Aim for 60-70 interviews to start seeing initial insights and patterns, and up to 100-150 interviews per segment on a national basis for more comprehensive understanding. This applies to potential users, buyers (e.g., university mental health authorities), and decision-makers in institutions. ( I-Corps Opening)  
* **Focus on Workflow and Pain Points:** During interviews, prioritize understanding the current workflow, how and when decisions are made, who is involved, and what resources are used. Identify clear impacts and consequences of current practices that HumorHealer could address, such as long waiting lists for therapy, lack of therapist availability, or cost barriers. ( I-Corps Opening)  
* **Avoid Product Bias:** Frame questions to learn about what makes mental health technology successful from the interviewee's perspective, rather than directly asking about or biasing them towards HumorHealer. ( ICORP Questions, I-Corps Opening)  
* **Identifying the "Job-to-be-Done":** Understand what "job" customers would "hire" HumorHealer to do, what solutions they are currently using, and why they would switch. People care about progress, not just products. ( I-Corps Opening)  
* **Quantifying Value in Industry:** Consider metrics like Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to quantify the value proposition, especially when presenting to institutions. This helps in understanding the worth of extending life or improving utility levels through the introduction of new techniques. ( Closing Remarks)

**Addressing Therapist Concerns and Integration:**

* **AI as a Complement, not Replacement:** Emphasize that HumorHealer can address the severe demand-supply gap in mental health by handling "easy cases," acting as a pre-screening or triage tool, and freeing up therapists for more serious or complex cases. The system could "flag" concerning conversations for human intervention, functioning as a human-in-the-loop system. ( Aug 9, 2024 | Diksha, Aug 2, 2024 | Vitor Meeting \- Consulting, Aug 13, 2024 | Ed Dannettel Interview, Bradley Kuo Interview)  
* **Data-Driven Insights for Institutions:** HumorHealer can gather universal sentiment and difficulty analysis (e.g., identifying common issues like "shitty food" on a submarine affecting morale). This anonymized data can be a significant value proposition for universities and the military to address common problems and improve overall well-being. ( I-Corps Opening)  
* **"Flagging" and Intervention:** The system should be designed to highlight concerning problems or "tag" conversations for potential therapist intervention, especially if it is involved in a medical context. ( Aug 2, 2024 | Vitor Meeting \- Consulting)

**Technical and Data Management Considerations:**

* **HIPAA Compliance:** If handling Protected Health Information (PHI), HIPAA compliance is crucial. This entails using HIPAA-compliant hosting (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud with specific settings, which can be significantly more expensive) and having Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with any third-party services (like texting APIs if they can read messages). End-to-end encryption and robust cybersecurity procedures are essential. ( Aug 2, 2024 | Vitor Meeting \- Consulting)  
* **"Do the Minimum Thing for Now":** For initial development, focus on essential infrastructure. Scaling can be addressed when it becomes a "good problem to have." ( Aug 2, 2024 | Vitor Meeting \- Consulting)  
* **Speech and Text Integration:** Utilize OpenAI's Whisper model for human-like speech and Twilio for text and voice interactions. ( Aug 2, 2024 | Vitor Meeting \- Consulting)  
* **Ethical AI and Liability:** HumorHealer needs robust safety guardrails. Responses should provide relevant options and suggestions ("consider/suggest/think about") rather than direct commands ("call this number"), especially in a school setting due to liability concerns. It cannot diagnose in a school setting. ( 8/7/24 \- Jacqueline Cochran)

**Patient Journey and User Experience:**

* **Addressing Accessibility and Waiting Lists:** HumorHealer directly addresses the widespread problem of long waiting lists for traditional therapy and the desire for increased accessibility. ( Aug 9, 2024 | Diksha, Bradley Kuo Interview, Aug 12, 2024 | Patrick Mitchell Interview, Aug 13, 2024 | Sandrine Pirard Interview)  
* **Self-Selection and Personalization:** The ability for patients to self-select treatment or a "type" of humor/therapeutic approach is a valuable feature. The AI should be able to adapt its humor to individual users. ( Bradley Kuo Interview, 8/13/24 \- Larry Hopwood)  
* **Actionable Steps:** The AI should consolidate advice into small, actionable steps, similar to how a human therapist would guide a client. ( 8/7/24 \- Jacqueline Cochran)  
* **Cultural Competence:** Training the model to understand cultural context is vital, as healing processes are often culturally based. ( Bradley Kuo Interview, Aug 14, 2024 | SAM INTERVIEW)  
* **Comfort and Trust:** The anonymity and non-judgmental nature of a chatbot can make it easier for individuals, especially those in early stages of addressing issues, to talk about their struggles without fear of judgment. ( Aug 13, 2024 | Ed Dannettel Interview, 8/22/24 \- Saumya Singh)

**Funding and Legal:**

* **Grant Opportunities:** Explore NSF/NIH I-CORP and SBIR/STTR grants (Phase 1: $250k, Phase 2: $1.5M; STTR requires non-profit collaboration). ( Closing Remarks)  
* **IP Protection and Licensing:** Seek legal advice on IP protection and licensing after initial prototype development. ( 8/14/24 \- Sephora)  
* **IRB Approval:** Obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval can offer liability protections. ( Aug 2, 2024 | Vitor Meeting \- Consulting)

**Growth Opportunities:**

* **JHU-APL Technology Collaborations:** Leverage the potential for technology collaborations with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL). ( Aug 13, 2024 | Ed Dannettel Interview)
