# Enhanced AI Prover Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the AI prover system to address the performance issues identified in the test results. The enhancements focus on **knowledge base enhancement**, **intelligent prompt engineering**, **proof planning**, and **error recovery**.

## 📊 Problem Analysis

### Original Performance Issues
- **16.7% success rate** on hard tests (1/6 successful)
- **High failure rate** on complex mathematical domains
- **Poor error recovery** - LLM gets stuck on incorrect tactics
- **Missing Lean library knowledge** - doesn't know available theorems
- **Vertex AI SDK deprecation warnings**

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Knowledge Gap**: LLM didn't know available Lean theorems and tactics
2. **Poor Prompt Engineering**: Generic prompts without context or error learning
3. **No Strategy Planning**: No systematic approach to proof decomposition
4. **Inadequate Error Recovery**: No intelligent retry mechanisms
5. **Deprecated API Usage**: Using deprecated Vertex AI SDK methods

## 🚀 Implemented Solutions

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Enhancement ✅

#### **lean_knowledge_base.py**

- **Categorized knowledge** by mathematical domain (arithmetic, logic, inequality, advanced)
- **Usage patterns** for each theorem with proper syntax
- **Automatic theorem suggestion** based on goal analysis
- **Available imports detection** from Lean project structure

**Key Features:**
```python
# Theorem database with usage examples
"Nat.add_zero": {
    "type": "theorem",
    "signature": "∀ (n : ℕ), n + 0 = n",
    "usage": "intro n; exact Nat.add_zero n",
    "category": "arithmetic"
}

# Automatic theorem suggestion
theorem = lean_kb.suggest_theorem("∀ n, n + 0 = n")  # Returns "Nat.add_zero"
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Prompt Engineering ✅

#### **enhanced_prompts.py**
- **Context-aware prompting** with available knowledge
- **Error-learning prompts** that learn from previous failures
- **Multi-strategy prompting** for different difficulty levels
- **Fallback prompts** when primary approaches fail
- **Error pattern recognition** and solution suggestions

**Key Features:**
```python
# Context-aware prompt with available theorems
prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_context_aware_prompt(
    goal, available_theorems, error_history, difficulty
)

# Error-learning prompt
prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_error_learning_prompt(
    goal, error_output, attempt_count, previous_attempts
)
```

### Phase 3: Intelligent Proof Planning ✅

#### **proof_planner.py**
- **Proof decomposition** for complex mathematical statements
- **Strategy selection** based on goal analysis and available knowledge
- **Tactic composition** for multi-step proofs
- **Adaptive strategy selection** with weighted scoring
- **Goal classification** and difficulty assessment

**Key Features:**
```python
# Strategy selection
strategy = proof_planner.select_proof_strategy(goal, available_theorems, difficulty)

# Proof decomposition
subgoals = proof_planner.decompose_complex_proof(goal)

# Tactic generation
tactic = proof_planner.generate_strategy_specific_tactic(goal, strategy, available_theorems)
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Lean Verifier ✅

#### **lean_verifier.py** (Enhanced)
- **Integrated knowledge base** for theorem suggestions
- **Enhanced prompt engineering** with context and error learning
- **Intelligent proof planning** with strategy selection

- **Improved error handling** and recovery

**Key Improvements:**
```python
# Enhanced auto-solve with knowledge integration
def auto_solve_proof(self, initial_proof_state: str, max_attempts: int = None):
    # Extract goal and analyze
    goal = self._extract_goal(initial_proof_state)
    goal_type = self._classify_goal_type(goal)
    difficulty = self._determine_difficulty(goal)
    
    # Select strategy and generate appropriate prompt
    strategy = proof_planner.select_proof_strategy(goal, available_theorems, difficulty)
    prompt = enhanced_prompts.create_context_aware_prompt(...)
    
    # Generate and verify tactic
    tactic = get_llm_response(prompt)
    result = self.run_lean_verification(new_state)
```

### Phase 5: Vertex AI SDK Fix ✅

#### **socratic_auditor.py** (Updated)
- **Fixed deprecation warnings** by using updated Vertex AI SDK
- **Updated API calls** to use `Part.from_text()` instead of direct string input
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with fallback mechanisms

**Key Changes:**
```python
# Updated Vertex AI API usage
response = model.generate_content(
    [Part.from_text(prompt)],  # Updated from direct string
    generation_config=generation_config
)
```
